  _bodyText: 'A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures
    when exposed to certain light effects or patterns in their daily environment.
    In some cases, these seizures can be triggered when viewing TV images or playing
    video software. Even players who have never had a seizure before may suffer from
    an undiagnosed form of epilepsy.


    If you or close relatives suffer from
    epilepsy, consult your doctor before using video games. If you experience any
    of the following symptoms (dizziness, altered vision, muscle twitching, any kind
    of uncontrolled movements, loss of consciousness, disorientation, and/or convulsions),
    stop playing immediately and consult a doctor.'
