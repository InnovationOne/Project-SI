  CatchText:
  - Three spines and a whole lot of attitude - this stickleback is all business.
  - Those spines won't help you now, stickleback. Into the bucket you go.
  - Sticklebacks are remarkable for their defensive spines, a marvel of evolution.
  - This stickleback could be the knight of the river, armor and all.
  - This stickleback is more spine than fish, a prickly little warrior of the water.
  - The stickleback's spines stand like tiny spears, ready and alert.
