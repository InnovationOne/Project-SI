  CatchText:
  - Caught an eel - looks like I'm in for a shocking good time!
  - You slippery devil, thought you could outwit me? Not today.
  - Eels have such an elegant design, perfect for navigating the darkest waters.
  - Like a sea serpent from a Jules Verne tale, this eel twisted into my net.
  - An eel... it's like catching a water rope with a mind of its own.
  - The eel's dark skin glistens, every move a whisper of wet silk.
