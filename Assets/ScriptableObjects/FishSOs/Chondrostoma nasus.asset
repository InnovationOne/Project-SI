  CatchText:
  - Hooked a nase - it seems my fishing instincts are right on the nose!
  - Nase, you can't outswim fate - or my net, for that matter.
  - Nase are bottom feeders, using their unique, downturned mouths to graze on algae
    and invertebrates.
  - This nase looks like it could be a character in a tale of river sprites and hidden
    streams.
  - This nase feels like holding a living piece of the riverbed, all grit and grace.
  - The nase's body is sleek and silvery, glinting like a polished pebble.
