  CatchText:
  - Caught the ocean's tiniest tough guy - this goby's got a lot of bark for such
    a small fish!
  - All that posturing, goby, and you still ended up in my net.
  - Goby fish - small, adaptable, and found in nearly every corner of the ocean.
  - If Dickens wrote about fish, this plucky goby would be his scrappy underdog.
  - This goby's got a look like it's ready to start a bar brawl.
  - Small and swift, this goby's got mottled colors that blend right into the rocks.
