  CatchText:
  - Caught a herring - silver of the sea, and twice as slippery!
  - This herring thought it could outswim me - wrong!
  - Known for their schooling behavior, herrings are a keystone species in marine
    ecosystems.
  - A fish that's fed kings and sailors alike - humble, yet essential.
  - Caught a fish that looks like it's always on the run - no rest for the humble
    herring.
  - Shimmering silver scales catch every ray, like a coin spinning in water.
