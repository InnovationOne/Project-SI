  CatchText:
  - Caught the ocean's very own discus champion - round, colorful, and always making
    a splash!
  - You can't hide when you're a neon sign of a fish, discus!
  - Discus fish are known for their vibrant colors and unique disc-shaped bodies,
    perfect for gliding through calm waters.
  - The discus fish - a kaleidoscope in motion, straight out of an artist's dream.
  - This discus fish looks like it's spent too much time in a stained glass window.
  - A bright, circular fish with swirling patterns of blue, red, and yellow, the
    discus glides elegantly through the water.
