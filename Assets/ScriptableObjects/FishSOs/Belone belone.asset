  CatchText:
  - Caught the sea's very own spear - garfish, the jouster of the deep!
  - You might be sharp, garfish, but not sharp enough to escape me.
  - With its long, pointed body, the garfish slices through water like a living spear.
  - If knights of the sea existed, this garfish would be wielding its snout like
    a lance.
  - Caught a fish that looks like it's more weapon than creature - what a strange
    sight.
  - A long, slender body with a needle-like snout, the garfish cuts through the water
    like an arrow.
