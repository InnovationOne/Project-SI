  CatchText:
  - Caught a dace - guess you could say I'm really dace-ing my way to victory!
  - Dace, you may be fast, but not fast enough to escape me!
  - Dace are agile swimmers, perfectly suited for life in fast-flowing rivers.
  - Caught a dace - feels like I've pulled a tiny river dancer from the stream.
  - This dace feels like holding a quicksilver flash, never quite still.
  - The dace's silver scales glint in the light, a living blade of the river.
