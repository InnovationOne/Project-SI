  CatchText:
  - Caught a spirlin - looks like I've got this fish spinning on my line!
  - Spirlin, you thought you were quick, but my line was quicker.
  - Spirlin are small, silvery fish often found in fast-flowing rivers, where they
    feed on small invertebrates.
  - Caught a spirlin - it's like reeling in a tiny, silvery flash of river light.
  - Holding this spirlin feels like gripping a small, living sliver of the river's
    silver light.
  - The spirlin's slender, silvery body reflects the sunlight, flashing like a living
    needle in the water.
