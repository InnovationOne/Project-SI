  - Caught a salmon - guess you could say I'm swimming in good fortune today!
  - Thought you'd make it upstream, salmon? Not on my watch.
  - Atlantic salmon are remarkable for their epic migrations, traveling thousands
    of miles to spawn.
  - The salmon's journey is the stuff of legends, a watery Odyssey in every leap.
  - Holding this salmon feels like catching a piece of the ocean's wild heart.
  - The salmon's sleek body shimmers in the light, a blend of silver and subtle blues.
