  CatchText:
  - Looks like I've caught the sea's very own mood swing on a bad day!
  - You look like you've lost a bet with the ocean - and the ocean won.
  - A victim of its own environment, this blobfish collapses without the ocean's
    pressure.
  - This fish looks like it belongs in a Dickens novel - just another sad character
    in a tragic sea tale.
  - I've fished up a wet sack of disappointment - oh wait, it's a fish.
  - "A saggy, pink lump with eyes that scream \u2018I'm over it."
