  CatchText:
  - Caught a lake trout - talk about a catch that's lake-tastic!
  - This lake trout thought it was safe in the depths - not with me around.
  - Lake trout are top predators in their cold, deep-water habitats, thriving in
    well-oxygenated lakes.
  - Caught a lake trout - it's like reeling in a deep-water legend from the lake's
    dark heart.
  - Holding this lake trout feels like gripping a cold, living shadow from the lake's
    depths.
  - The lake trout's mottled scales blend with the rocky bottom, a pattern of greens,
    grays, and blacks.
