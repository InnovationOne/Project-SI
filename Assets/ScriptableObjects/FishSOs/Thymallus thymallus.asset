  CatchText:
  - Caught a grayling; now my day is officially fin-tastic!
  - This grayling thought it was clever. I thought better.
  - Graylings are like living paintings with fins of iridescent light.
  - This grayling shimmers like something out of a Victorian watercolor.
  - This grayling moves like a whisper in the water, barely there but impossible
    to ignore.
  - The grayling's scales flash like tiny mirrors catching the sun's light.
