  CatchText:
  - Caught a sunfish - guess I'm really basking in today's catch!
  - Sunfish, you thought you were all flash, but now you're in my net.
  - Sunfish are known for their vibrant colors and rounded bodies, often found basking
    in warm, shallow waters.
  - Caught a sunfish - it's like reeling in a little piece of sunlight.
  - Holding this sunfish feels like cradling a warm, living ray of sun.
  - The sunfish's bright, iridescent scales reflect the light in flashes of gold,
    green, and blue.
