  CatchText:
  - Trout-standing catch of the day, if I do say so myself.
  - Thought you were sly, river trout? My line had other plans.
  - River trout, streamlined perfection - built to thrive in fast-moving waters.
  - This trout's fight reminded me of Hemingway's tales of fish and man.
  - It's like catching a piece of the river's spirit, this lively trout.
  - The trout's scales shimmer like the river's surface at dawn, cool and bright.
