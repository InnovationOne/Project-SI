  - Arctic char, you thought you could hide in the cold depths, but I've got you
    now.

    the harshest aquatic environments.

    and vivid against the cold
  - Holding this Arctic char feels like gripping a shard of the frozen north, bright
    and alive.
  - The Arctic char's vibrant scales shimmer in shades of pink, orange, and red,
    contrasting with the blue water.
