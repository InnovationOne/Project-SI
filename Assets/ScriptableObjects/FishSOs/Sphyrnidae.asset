  CatchText:
  - "Caught the carpenter of the sea - this shark's got a real \u2018nailed it' vibe."
  - You've got a head like a hammer, but you still ended up on my hook.
  - The hammerhead's unique head shape gives it exceptional vision and maneuverability.
  - This shark looks like it swam straight out of a mad inventor's blueprints.
  - I've caught a shark that looks like it's wearing its own strange helmet.
  - A broad, hammer-like head with eyes set wide, scanning the sea like a living
    periscope.
