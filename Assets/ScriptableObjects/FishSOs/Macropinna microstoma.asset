  CatchText:
  - Caught a fish with a head so transparent, it's like it's got nothing to hide!
  - All those see-through brains, and still you ended up on my line!
  - The barreleye - an evolutionary wonder with a transparent head to spot prey from
    any angle.
  - This fish looks like it belongs in a Jules Verne novel - part creature, part
    contraption.
  - I've caught a fish that looks like it's already been dissected!
  - A clear dome for a skull, with eyes that roll like marbles in a glass case.
