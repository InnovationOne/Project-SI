  - This piranha's got more bite than bark - better keep my fingers clear!
  - Not so tough now, are you, piranha? All teeth and nowhere to go!
  - Piranhas are known for their sharp teeth and strong jaws, which can tear through
    flesh in seconds.
  - A creature of nightmares, this piranha's got a reputation as the river's little
    monster.
  - Caught a piranha that looks like it's ready to bite the hand that hooked it.
  - Small but fierce, the piranha's sharp teeth glint as it thrashes in the water.
