  CatchText:
  - Caught myself a living tube sock with teeth - moray eel, the sea's grumpiest
    resident.
  - Thought you could hide in your little cave forever? Not today, moray!
  - Moray eels are known for their long, sinuous bodies and fearsome, tooth-filled
    jaws.
  - The moray eel - like a villain lurking in the shadows of a maritime mystery.
  - Caught an eel that looks like it's been holding a grudge for years.
  - A long, sinuous body covered in slick, mottled skin, the moray eel slithers through
    the reef's crevices.
