  CatchText:
  - Caught a rudd - talk about a fish with a ruddy good look!
  - This rudd thought it could hide, but my net had other plans.
  - Rudd are recognized by their golden scales and bright red fins, making them a
    striking sight in freshwater.
  - This rudd's golden body could belong in a waterside painting, glowing in the
    afternoon sun.
  - Holding this rudd feels like gripping a small, golden flame, flickering with
    life.
  - The rudd's golden scales catch the light, shining like a coin freshly minted
    from the river.
