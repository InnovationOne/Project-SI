  CatchText:
  - Caught a sabrefish - this catch is sharp and slick as a blade!
  - Sabrefish, you thought you were swift, but my hook was sharper.
  - Sabrefish are known for their sharp, elongated bodies and forked tails, perfectly
    designed for swift, agile swimming.
  - Caught a sabrefish - it's like holding a piece of water's sharpest poetry, swift
    and gleaming.
  - Holding this sabrefish feels like gripping a sliver of the river's cutting edge,
    sleek and swift.
  - The sabrefish's sleek, silver body glistens like a finely polished blade, cutting
    through the water with ease.
