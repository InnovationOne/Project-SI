  CatchText:
  - Caught a bitterling - guess it's a bitter-sweet victory!
  - Thought you were a quick one, didn't you, little bitterling? Not quick enough.
  - The bitterling's vivid colors are a telltale sign of its fascinating lifecycle.
  - This bitterling looks like it could swim straight out of a Japanese ukiyo-e print.
  - This tiny fish is like a living shard of stained glass, delicate and bright.
  - The bitterling's scales shimmer like a kaleidoscope of colors under the sun.
