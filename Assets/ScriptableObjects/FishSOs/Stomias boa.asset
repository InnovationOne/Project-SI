  CatchText:
  - Caught the ocean's most fearsome little dragon - scaly dragonfish, all teeth
    and terror!
  - Thought you could stay hidden in the dark, did you, dragonfish? Not this time!
  - Scaly dragonfish are deep-sea predators, known for their bioluminescent bodies
    and fearsome teeth.
  - A creature of nightmares, the dragonfish is like a sea serpent trapped in a fish's
    body.
  - Caught a dragonfish that looks like it's planning something sinister - glowing
    all the while.
  - A small, elongated body with scales that glimmer faintly in the dark, the dragonfish
    is both eerie and beautiful.
