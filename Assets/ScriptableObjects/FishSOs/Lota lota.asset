  CatchText:
  - This burbot tried to burrow away, but it's hooked now!
  - Thought you could hide in the murky depths, burbot? Not from me.
  - Burbot are the only freshwater members of the cod family, perfectly adapted to
    cold, deep waters.
  - This burbot looks like it could be the lurking creature in a dark river legend.
  - This burbot feels like holding a slippery, living shadow from the river's deep.
  - The burbot's mottled skin blends seamlessly with the riverbed, dark and speckled.
