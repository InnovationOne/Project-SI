  CatchText:
  - This wrasse's got a forehead that could stop a steam train - talk about a hard
    head!
  - Big head, little brains - didn't see my hook coming, did you, humphead?
  - The humphead wrasse is one of the largest reef fish, known for its distinct hump
    and vibrant colors.
  - If fish had boxers, the humphead wrasse would be the undefeated heavyweight champ
    of the sea
  - Caught a wrasse that's all head and no subtlety - this one's not hiding from
    anyone.
  - A massive, colorful fish with a prominent hump, this wrasse's head is its most
    striking feature.
