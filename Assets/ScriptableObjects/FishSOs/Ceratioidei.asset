  - Thought you'd reel me in with your little light show? Not today!
  - A living light bulb, the anglerfish is the predator and illusionist of the deep.

  - This fish looks like it's been rejected from a steampunk horror novel.
  - With a glowing lure and jagged teeth, this fish is equal parts eerie and entrancing.
