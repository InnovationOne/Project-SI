  CatchText:
  - Looks like I've fished up a giant pancake with fins - sunfish, the sea's flattest
    resident!
  - All that size, and still you couldn't avoid me - better luck drifting next time!
  - The ocean sunfish, or Mola Mola, is one of the heaviest bony fish, known for
    its disc-like shape and docile nature.
  - The ocean sunfish - a fish that's more sunbather than swimmer, basking like a
    king on the sea's surface.
  - This sunfish looks like it's got nowhere to be and all day to get there.
  - A giant, rounded body with tiny fins, this sunfish looks more like a drifting
    disc than a fish.
