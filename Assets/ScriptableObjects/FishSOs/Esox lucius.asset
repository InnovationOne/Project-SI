  CatchText:
  - Caught a pike - looks like I've really spiked today's catch!
  - You thought you were the top predator, pike? Not today.
  - Pike are apex predators, equipped with sharp teeth and a streamlined body for
    ambush hunting.
  - This pike could be the dragon of the river, lurking in the depths with a menacing
    grin.
  - This pike feels like a living weapon, poised and powerful even out of water.
  - The pike's scales are dark and mottled, blending perfectly with the shadowy waters.
