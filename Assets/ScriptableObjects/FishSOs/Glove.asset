  CatchText:
  - I guess I can finally 'hand'le my fishing better with this glove.
  - Even the fish are mocking me with this glove as a prize.
  - This glove exemplifies the fusion of practicality and ornate steampunk aesthetics.
  - This glove makes me think of the adventurers in Jules Verne's tales.
  - A glove swimming here? Maybe it's enchanted to protect against underwater gears.
  - The glove's brass buttons glint under the gaslit lamp.
