  CatchText:
  - Looks like I've just joined the circus of the sea - meet the head clown!
  - Seems the joke's on you this time, funny fish!
  - Fascinating! A clownfish, master of disguise and deception in the coral world.
  - I've caught the sea's very own Puck, straight out of a watery Midsummer Night's
    Dream.
  - Did I just catch the star of an underwater vaudeville act?
  - Bright stripes and a smug little grin - this one's a real show-off.
