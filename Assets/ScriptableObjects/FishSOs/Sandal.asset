  CatchText:
  - My sandals are a perfect 'sole'mate for any steampunk exploration.
  - Great, now my catch includes some open-toed sandals - how delightful.
  - These sandals demonstrate a fusion of comfort and steampunk fashion prevalent
    in the 19th century.
  - Wearing these sandals feels like being a character in a Victorian-era steampunk
    novel.
  - A pair of sandals underwater? Maybe they're enchanted to let me walk on submerged
    pathways.
  - The sandals sparkle with tiny gears and buckles under the steam-lit sky.
