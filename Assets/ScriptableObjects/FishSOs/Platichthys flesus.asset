  CatchText:
  - This flounder's been floundering - flat out of luck and onto my hook!
  - Caught you napping, did I? Should have kept a lower profile!
  - The flounder's unique sideways shape is a marvel of evolution and camouflage.
  - If Kafka wrote about fish, this flounder would be his protagonist - bizarre and
    down-to-earth.
  - I've caught a fish that looks like it just gave up on the third dimension.
  - With both eyes on one side, this fish watches the world from a skewed perspective.
