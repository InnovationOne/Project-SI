  CatchText:
  - I'm bream-ing with pride after catching this beauty.
  - This bream tried to outsmart me - didn't work out too well, did it?
  - The bream's rounded shape and silver sheen are marks of a classic river dweller.
  - This bream looks like it swam right out of an Impressionist painting.
  - This bream feels like holding a moonbeam - silvery, soft, and fleeting.
  - The bream's scales catch the light, reflecting a soft, silvery glow.
