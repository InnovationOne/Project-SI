  CatchText:
  - Caught the ocean's own torpedo - tuna, all speed and no brakes!
  - You might be fast, tuna, but not fast enough to dodge my hook!
  - Tuna are among the fastest swimmers in the ocean, capable of reaching speeds
    up to 75 km/h.
  - This tuna swims like it's racing against time - straight out of a maritime legend.
  - This fish looks like it's been sprinting its whole life - no time to slow down,
    ever.
  - A sleek, muscular body with a shining silver-blue hue, the tuna cuts through
    the water like a living missile.
