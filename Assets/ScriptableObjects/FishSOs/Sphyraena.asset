  CatchText:
  - Looks like I've just reeled in the ocean's meanest smile!
  - Caught the bully of the sea - how the tables have turned!
  - A remarkable predator, the barracuda boasts speed, strength, and an intimidating
    bite.
  - This fish could rival any pirate's ferocity on the high seas.
  - If glares could kill, I'd be swimming with the fish.
  - Its scales gleam like polished metal, and its eyes pierce like daggers.
