  CatchText:
  - Looks like I've caught the ocean's ink master - squid, the original underwater
    artist!
  - Thought your ink could hide you? Not this time, squid!
  - Squid are remarkable cephalopods, using jet propulsion and ink for defense.
  - A creature of mystery and ink, this squid's straight from the pages of a nautical
    legend.
  - Caught a squid that's all arms, ink, and mischief - what a slippery character.
  - A blur of arms and flashing chromatophores, this squid is a master of camouflage
    and speed.
