  CatchText:
  - Caught a perch - looks like I'm perching myself on the winner's spot today!
  - Thought those spines would keep you safe, perch? Guess again.
  - European perch are apex predators in their habitats, perfectly suited for stealth
    and speed.
  - With its regal stripes, this perch could be the heraldry of a knight's shield.
  - This perch feels like holding a river's little predator, all spines and strategy.
  - The perch's stripes shimmer in the light, dark bands crossing its green-gold
    body.
