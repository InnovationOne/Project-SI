  CatchText:
  - Caught the ocean's tiniest knight - seahorse, riding the currents like a chivalrous
    steed!
  - Thought you could blend in with the coral? Not today, little rider!
  - Seahorses are unique for their horse-like heads and curled tails, using their
    prehensile tails to anchor to seagrass.
  - A creature fit for a fairy tale, the seahorse looks like it swam straight out
    of a medieval bestiary.
  - This seahorse has the demeanor of a tiny sea monarch - elegant, upright, and
    utterly regal.
  - Its small, curled tail and upright body give the seahorse an otherworldly, delicate
    grace as it moves.
