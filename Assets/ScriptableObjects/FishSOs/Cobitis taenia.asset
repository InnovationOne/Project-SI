  CatchText:
  - Hooked a loach - looks like I've found the river's slippery secret!
  - You thought you could hide in the mud, loach? Not today.
  - Loaches are bottom dwellers, perfectly adapted to life in silt and gravel with
    their elongated bodies.
  - Caught a loach - it's like pulling up a little river secret, slippery and silent.
  - Holding this loach feels like gripping a sliver of the river's muddy undercurrent.
  - The loach's slim body blends seamlessly with the riverbed, all browns and soft
    yellows.
