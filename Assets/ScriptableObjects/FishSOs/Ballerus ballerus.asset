  - Blue bream, you thought you were hidden, but I see through the blues!
  - Blue bream are recognized by their unique blue-gray scales and deep, compressed
    bodies.
  - Caught a blue bream - it's like pulling a soft, blue note from the river's quiet
    song.
  - Holding this blue bream feels like gripping a soft, cool shadow of the lake's
    surface.
  - The blue bream's scales shimmer with soft blues and grays, reflecting the cool,
    calm waters it calls home.
