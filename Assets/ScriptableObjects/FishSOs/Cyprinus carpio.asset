  CatchText:
  - Caught a carp - looks like I'm carping diem today!
  - Carp, you thought you were clever - too bad my hook was smarter.
  - Carp are remarkable survivors, thriving in environments from ponds to large rivers.
  - Caught a carp - it's like reeling in a living part of an ancient waterway.
  - The carp in my hands feels like the river's memory, quiet and heavy with time.
  - The carp's body is broad and powerful, its scales a mix of gold, green, and brown.
