  CatchText:
  - Caught a bleak - this catch is anything but gloomy!
  - Bleak, you thought you were too quick for me, didn't you?
  - Bleak are surface feeders, darting just below the water's top, always on the
    lookout for insects.
  - Caught a bleak - it's like pulling a piece of reflected moonlight from the water.
  - This bleak feels like holding a living shard of silver, flickering with light.
  - The bleak's scales flash bright and silver, reflecting every flicker of sunlight.
