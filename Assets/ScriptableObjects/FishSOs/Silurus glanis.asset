  CatchText:
  - Caught a catfish - this catch is purr-fectly whiskered!
  - Catfish, you might be sly, but not sly enough to avoid my net.
  - Catfish are known for their whisker-like barbels, which help them sense food
    in murky waters.
  - Caught a catfish - it's like reeling in a story from the river's hidden places.
  - Holding this catfish feels like gripping a quiet, whiskered mystery of the river.
  - The catfish's smooth, scaleless body glides easily, dark and sleek in the water.
