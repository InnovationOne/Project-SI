  - Caught the sea's most notorious tough guy - shark, the original bad boy of the
    ocean!

  - The shark - a perfect predator, evolved over millions of years to dominate the
    seas.
  - The shark - a creature that's haunted sailors' nightmares since time immemorial.
  - I've caught the sea's top predator - hope it doesn't have friends nearby.
