  CatchText:
  - Caught the ocean's own flying carpet - ray, gliding through the sea with all
    the grace of a lazy bird!
  - Smooth and stealthy, but not stealthy enough to avoid my hook, ray!
  - Rays are flattened relatives of sharks, using their broad fins to glide gracefully
    along the ocean floor.
  - The ray - a fish that's more phantom than flesh, gliding like a wraith in the
    deep.
  - "This ray's got a look that says, \u2018I'm not here, you didn't see me' - too
    bad, fish!"
  - A broad, flat body and long, sweeping fins make this ray look like a living blanket
    of the sea.
