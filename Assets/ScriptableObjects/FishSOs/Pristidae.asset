  CatchText:
  - Caught the ocean's buzzsaw on fins - sawfish, slicing through the sea with style!
  - Thought you could carve your way out of trouble? Not today, sawfish!
  - Sawfish are rays with long, toothed snouts used for slashing prey and defending
    against predators.
  - The sawfish - a creature that looks like it swam out of a pirate's tool chest,
    all blade and bravado.
  - This sawfish looks like it's planning to cut its way through anything in its
    path - what a menacing blade!
  - A long, toothed snout juts forward like a living blade, giving the sawfish a
    fierce, predatory look.
