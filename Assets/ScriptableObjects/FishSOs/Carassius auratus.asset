  CatchText:
  - Caught a goldfish - guess I've struck gold today!
  - Caught you shining bright, goldfish. Better luck hiding next time.
  - Goldfish are resilient survivors, bred from humble carp to become jewels of the
    pond.
  - This goldfish looks like it swam straight out of an old Chinese scroll.
  - Holding this goldfish feels like gripping a tiny, living sunbeam.
  - The goldfish's scales catch the light, shimmering with bright oranges and golds.
