  - This wrasse is strutting its colors like it's in an underwater fashion show!
  - All dressed up and nowhere to go - except into my net, peacock!
  - Peacock wrasse are known for their vivid colors, which they use for both mating
    and camouflage.
  - This fish could rival any artist's palette - bright, bold, and unashamedly showy.
  - This wrasse looks like it's in a permanent state of celebration - party on, fish!
  - A flash of bright blues, greens, and yellows - the peacock wrasse is a swimming
    work of art.
