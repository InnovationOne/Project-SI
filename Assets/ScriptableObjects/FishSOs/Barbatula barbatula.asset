  CatchText:
  - Caught a stone loach - guess you could say I'm on a rock-solid streak!
  - Thought you were safe in the rocks? Not from me, loach.
  - Stone loaches are masters of disguise, blending seamlessly with the riverbed.
  - This loach's elusive nature is straight out of a Victorian mystery.
  - This stone loach feels like a pebble with a pulse, alive in my hand.
  - The loach's earthy tones blend perfectly with the stones, a living piece of the
    river.
