  CatchText:
  - The blue marlin - part fish, part sword, all attitude!
  - For all that flair and fight, you still end up on my line.
  - The blue marlin - a master sprinter of the sea, built for speed and strength.
  - As if pulled straight from Hemingway's dreams, this fish is the old man's prize.
  - Why does this fish look like it's challenging me to a duel?
  - Blue scales shimmer like ocean waves, and its bill gleams like polished steel.
