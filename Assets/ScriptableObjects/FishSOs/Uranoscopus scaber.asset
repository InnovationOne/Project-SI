  CatchText:
  - I've caught the dreamer of the sea - always with its head in the... sand.
  - Too busy looking at the sky to notice my hook, huh?
  - The stargazer - an ambush predator that lies in wait, staring skyward.
  - A seer of the deep, this fish is half fish, half celestial dreamer.
  - Why does this fish look like it's plotting the next constellation?
  - A flat body and upward eyes, like it's always looking to the stars above.
