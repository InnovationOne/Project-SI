  CatchText:
  - Caught a fish that's sharper than a scalpel - who needs a doctor?
  - For all your fancy scalpel fins, you're still on my line!
  - The surgeonfish - armed with scalpel-like fins for defense and maneuvering.
  - A blade with a fish attached - this one belongs in a pirate's arsenal.
  - With fins like these, I half expect this fish to offer surgery tips.
  - Sleek and blue with a razor edge - this fish is sharp in every sense.
