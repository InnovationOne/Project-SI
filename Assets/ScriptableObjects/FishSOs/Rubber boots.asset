  CatchText:
  - With these rubber boots, I'm 'stomping' through the steampunk waters.
  - Great, now my catch includes soggy rubber boots - how charming.
  - These rubber boots are crafted from vulcanized rubber, providing excellent waterproofing.
  - Wearing these rubber boots feels like being a character in a Victorian-era steampunk
    novel.
  - A pair of rubber boots underwater? Maybe they're enchanted to allow walking on
    submerged gears.
  - The rubber boots shimmer with a slick, oil-like sheen under the steam-powered
    lights.
