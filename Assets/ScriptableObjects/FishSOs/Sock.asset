  CatchText:
  - This sock really 'stepped up' my game on the steampunk rivers.
  - Even the fish are mocking me with this sock as a prize.
  - This sock appears to be woven from high-tensile steampunk fibers, enhancing its
    durability.
  - Like Cinderella's lost slipper, this sock holds secrets of the steampunk realms.
  - I never expected to reel in a sock; perhaps it's enchanted for some steampunk
    ritual.
  - The sock's vibrant stripes shimmer under the steam-powered lamplight.
