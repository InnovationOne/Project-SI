  CatchText:
  - This grouper's got more red than a sunset - too bad it's seeing the inside of
    my net now!
  - You might be the big boss of the reef, but you're no match for me, grouper!
  - Red groupers are known for their vibrant coloration and strong, robust bodies,
    perfect for reef life.
  - The red grouper - a fish that would be right at home in a salty sea yarn, all
    bold color and attitude.
  - Caught a red grouper that seems ready to charge the next coral it sees.
  - Its robust, deep-red body stands out against the reef, like a fiery gem among
    rocks.
