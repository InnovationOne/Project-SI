  CatchText:
  - Caught a gudgeon - guess I'm gudgeon along just fine today!
  - Small but mighty, this gudgeon thought it could escape - guess not.
  - Gudgeons are often overlooked, but they play a vital role in the river's food
    chain.
  - Caught a gudgeon - feels like I've hooked a little character from an old river
    fable.
  - This gudgeon feels like holding a little piece of the river's quicksilver spirit.
  - The gudgeon's sleek, slender form is a flash of silver and subtle browns.
