  CatchText:
  - Caught a sturgeon - looks like I've found the dinosaur of the deep!
  - Sturgeon, you're old, but not old enough to outsmart me.
  - Sturgeon are ancient fish, dating back over 200 million years, with armor-like
    scales and a distinct, shark-like tail.
  - Caught a sturgeon - it's like holding a piece of ancient waters, heavy with history.
  - Holding this sturgeon feels like gripping a piece of time itself, ancient and
    unyielding.
  - The sturgeon's bony scales glint dully, like old armor pulled from the depths.
