  CatchText:
  - Caught the sea's own spiky stress ball - pufferfish in all its puffed-up glory!
  - Puff all you want, little fish - you're still on my line!
  - The pufferfish's unique defense mechanism allows it to inflate rapidly, deterring
    predators.
  - If Aesop wrote about fish, this puffer would be the cautionary tale - too much
    puff, not enough punch.
  - "Caught a fish that looks like it's in permanent \u2018don't mess with me' mode."
  - A round, spiky sphere with big eyes - this pufferfish is part balloon, part pincushion.
