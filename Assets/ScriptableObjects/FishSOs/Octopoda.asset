  CatchText:
  - This octopus has more tricks up its arms than a stage magician - what a crafty
    catch!
  - Ink all you want, you're not escaping my line this time, crafty one!
  - With three hearts, blue blood, and a brain in every arm, octopuses are the masterminds
    of the sea.
  - If Jules Verne wrote about octopuses, this one would be plotting something devious
    from the depths.
  - Caught an octopus that looks like it's got a backup plan for every tentacle.
  - Its eight arms writhe and curl, each covered in suckers that grip like tiny,
    powerful hands.
