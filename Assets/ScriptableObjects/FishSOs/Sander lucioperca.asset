  CatchText:
  - Caught a pike perch - this catch is zander-ful!
  - Pike perch, you thought you could outsmart me - think again!
  - Pike perch, or zander, are skilled predators, known for their sharp teeth and
    keen hunting skills.
  - Caught a pike perch - it's like holding a little underwater assassin, swift and
    silent.
  - Holding this pike perch feels like gripping a sharp, sleek fragment of the river's
    hunger.
  - The pike perch's silvery scales shimmer faintly, a blend of greens, grays, and
    golds.
