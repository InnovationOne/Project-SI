  - This vampire squid's more goth than any fish I've seen - black, red, and all
    dramatic!
  - All that cloak and mystery, and still you ended up on my line - tough break,
    Dracula!
  - The vampire squid is a deep-sea cephalopod, known for its dark, webbed arms and
    bioluminescent displays.
  - The vampire squid looks like it swam out of a gothic novel - dark, dramatic,
    and hauntingly beautiful.
  - This vampire squid's got the look of something that haunts the deep - quiet,
    eerie, and a bit too stylish.
  - A dark, velvety body with webbed arms, the vampire squid glides through the water
    like a living shadow
