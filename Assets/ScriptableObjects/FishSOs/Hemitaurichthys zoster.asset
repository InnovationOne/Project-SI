  - This fish looks like it's dressed for a masquerade ball - too bad it's fashionably
    late.
  - Thought your fancy stripes would help you hide? Not today, butterfly.
  - With striking black and white patterns, this butterflyfish is a master of camouflage.
  - Straight out of a marine masquerade, this fish is the belle of the reef.
  - Why does this fish look like it's dressed to impress the coral court?
  - Striking black and white stripes, like a living art deco piece of the sea.
