  CatchText:
  - Looks like I've hooked the ocean's little speedster - mackerel, all flash and
    dash!
  - All that speed, and you still ended up in my net - tough luck, mackerel!
  - Mackerel are built for speed, their sleek bodies slicing through water with ease
    and efficiency.
  - If the ocean had its own racehorse, the mackerel would wear the crown.
  - This mackerel looks like it's late for an important meeting - always rushing,
    never resting.
  - A sleek, silver body with shimmering stripes, this mackerel glints in the sunlight
    like a living blade.
